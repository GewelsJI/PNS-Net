# Evaluation Toolbox for Video Polyp Segmentation (VPS)

This code is used for our paper _Progressively Normalized Self-Attention Network for Video Polyp Segmentation_, which is provisionally accepted at MICCAI 2021 conference. Our project page is avaliable at [website](http://dpfan.net/pranet/).

## Features

A simple-to-use toolbox for the evaluation of widely-used metrics (e.g., Dice, IoU, weighted-Fmeasure, Sensitivity, Specificity, Structure measure, Enhanced-alignment measure, and MAE) in medical segmentation, which provide the out-of-the-box functionality.

## Usage

Please set the candidate list of method and dataset in [Line-26](https://github.com/GewelsJI/PNS-Net/blob/7c3996afa3aeacad2316d76b7b4747c8579a9b35/eval/main_VPS.m#L26) and [Line-28](https://github.com/GewelsJI/PNS-Net/blob/7c3996afa3aeacad2316d76b7b4747c8579a9b35/eval/main_VPS.m#L28), respectively. 
You guys first need to install the Matlab first.
To this endï¼Œ you just run:

```bash
cd eval 
matlab main_VPS.m
```
