# Evaluation Toolbox for Video Polyp Segmentation (VPS)

This code is used for our paper _Progressively Normalized Self-Attention Network for Video Polyp Segmentation_, 
which is provisionally accepted at MICCAI 2021 conference. 
Our project page is at [website](http://dpfan.net/pranet/).

# Usage

Please set the candidate list of method and dataset in [Line-26](https://github.com/GewelsJI/PNS-Net/blob/7c3996afa3aeacad2316d76b7b4747c8579a9b35/eval/main_VPS.m#L26) and [Line-28](https://github.com/GewelsJI/PNS-Net/blob/7c3996afa3aeacad2316d76b7b4747c8579a9b35/eval/main_VPS.m#L28), respectively. 
You guys first need to install the Matlab first.
To this endï¼Œ you just run:

matlab main_VPS.m
```
